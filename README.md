# Notes on AI Agents 🤖

An **AI Agent** is an AI model designed to **reason**, **plan**, and interact autonomously with its environment by utilizing a set of **tools** it has access to.

## Core Components

AI agents typically leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as their core "brain" for:

1.  🧠 **Reasoning & Planning:** Understanding user requests, breaking down complex goals into steps, and devising a strategy.
2.  ⚙️ **Action Generation:** Determining which available tool is appropriate for a task and generating the necessary instructions (often code or parameters) to use that tool.

## The Role of Tools 🛠️

Agents use **tools** to perform actions and interact beyond the LLM's inherent text-generation capabilities. The **design, availability, and quality** of these tools significantly determine the agent's overall capability and effectiveness.

* **General Purpose Tools:** These offer broad functionality (e.g., 🌐 Web Search, 💻 Code Execution, 📅 Accessing Current Date/Time).
* **Specific Tools:** These are designed for particular tasks (e.g., interacting with a specific API, database, or function).

## Example Scenario: Sending an Email 📧

Let's say you give the agent access to an email tool:

```python
def send_message_to(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str):
  """
  Useful for sending an email message to a specific recipient
  with a given subject and body.
  """
  # ... actual code to interface with an email API/service ...
  print(f"Simulating: Email sent to {recipient} | Subject: {subject} | Body: {body}")
  return "Email successfully sent."
